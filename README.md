# Alekhya Portfolio (Static)

This is a static portfolio site (HTML/CSS/JS) designed for GitHub Pages.

## Quick start
1. Upload these files to your GitHub repo.
2. If this is a **project** repo:
   - Go to **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** / **root**
3. If this is your **user site** repo (`username.github.io`), same setup — it will publish automatically.

## Updating content
- Edit text in `index.html`
- Styles live in `styles.css`
- Subtle scroll reveal animation is in `script.js`
- Replace the hero image at `assets/headshot.jpg`

## Notes
- No build step
- Works locally by opening `index.html` in your browser
